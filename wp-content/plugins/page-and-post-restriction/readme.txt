== Description ==
PAGE RESTRICTION | RESTRICT POST  | PROTECT CONTENT FOR WORDPRESS

Page restriction and Post Restriction provides content control for WordPress sites. This provides Page Restriction and Post Restriction i.e.
Control on content access based on User Roles. You can Protect content by setting consent for single entity users on WordPress sites based on their roles. Here a user role has permission to get to a page; the authorization enables access to that user. By default, all roles will have access to a page.
It also allows providing content access to only Logged In Users to specific or all pages and posts. Logged out users see an error message letting them know that they do not have access to look into the content on the particular page.

Besides Page Restrictions, we also provide Post Restrictions (Content restriction) feature which helps to Protect content by Restricting access for posts on logged in/out status to users or specific user roles. Our WordPress Post restrictions feature also helps you to Restrict access in categories to logged in/out users or specific user roles. We Display a custom message to users who do not have permission to view the content or redirect them to a specified URL. In our Page restriction, Post restriction Plugin our Individual Posts feature will enable protection for default posts as well as custom post types.
