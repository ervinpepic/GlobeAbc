    <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
    <p>I am developing HD Quiz in my spare time, but still plan to add the following features at some point</p>
    <ul class="hdq_list">
        <li>Quiz styler <span class="hdq_tooltip hdq_tooltip_question">?<span class="hdq_tooltip_content"><span>This
                        would allow you to change the fonts and colours of the quizzes across your
                        site</span></span></span></li>
        <li>Logged in only <span class="hdq_tooltip hdq_tooltip_question">?<span class="hdq_tooltip_content"><span>This
                        would hide the quiz for non-registered users.</span></span></span></li>
        <li>Global / default quiz options <span class="hdq_tooltip hdq_tooltip_question">?<span
                    class="hdq_tooltip_content"><span>These would become the default for all quizzes, but could be
                        overridden on a per-quiz basis.</span></span></span></li>
        <li>Translation ready (please contacting me if you are interested in helping with translations)</li>

    <p>HD Quiz was designed to be as easy and intuitive to use as possible. However, I understand that some guidance
        might still be needed. The following are the "quick steps" needed to create your first quiz!</p>	
	
    <div class="hdq_accordion">
        <h3>Using A Quiz - Adding Quiz To a Page</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                HD Quiz uses shortcodes to render a quiz, so you can place a quiz almost anywhere on your site!
            </p>
            <ul class="hdq_list">
                <li>To find the shortcode for a quiz, select HD Quiz -&gt; Quizzes in the left menu.</li>
                <li>You will now see a list of all of your quizzes in a table, with the shortcode listed. <span class="hdq_tooltip hdq_tooltip_question">?<span class="hdq_tooltip_content"><span>Example shortcode <code>[HDquiz quiz = "xxx"]</code></span></span></span></li>
                <li>Copy and paste the shortcode into any page or post you want to render that quiz!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Gutenberg</strong>: HD Quiz is also fully Gutenberg compatible, and I even coded in a custom
                Gutenberg block to make adding quizzes easier than ever! If you are using Gutenberg, then you can add
                the HD Quiz block. A block will be added to your editor and will automatically populate a list of all of
                your quizzes. Simply select the quiz you wish to add and save.

        <h3>Changing Question Order</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The latest and greatest version of HD Quiz makes creating custom question order easier than
                ever! When
                editing a quiz, you can simply drag and drop to change the order of the questions. Just
                remember to save
                the quiz when done!
